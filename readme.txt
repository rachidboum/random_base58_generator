This Python code generates all possible passwords of a specified length, using a set of allowed characters. The output is split across multiple files to avoid exceeding a specified maximum file size.

Requirements
Python 3.x

Usage

Open a command prompt or terminal window.
Navigate to the directory containing the password_generator.py file.
Run the following command: python password_generator.py
Enter the desired password length when prompted.
Wait for the code to finish running. The generated password files will be saved in the same directory as the password_generator.py file.
Configuration
The following variables in the password_generator.py file can be adjusted to configure the password generation:

allowed_chars: a string containing all the allowed characters for the password. Default is "123456789ABCDEFGHJKMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz".
desired_length: the desired length of the password. Default is 8.
max_file_size: the maximum size of each output file, in bytes. Default is 50 * 1024 * 1024, or 50 MB.
Output
The code generates one or more text files containing all possible passwords of the specified length, using the allowed characters. Each file is named possible_keys_<file_number>.txt, where <file_number> is a sequential number starting from 1.

Note that generating passwords longer than 10 characters may result in a large number of output files and may take a long time to complete. Additionally, generating passwords with a large set of allowed characters may also result in a large number of output files. It is recommended to adjust the max_file_size variable accordingly.
